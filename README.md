# Book api refactor GrapQL

## Description 

This project involves refactoring an existing book list application that originally utilized the Google Books API to manage book lists, users, and related data. The main goal of this refactor is to replace the current RESTful API approach with GraphQL to enhance flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.

## Instalation

N/A

## Usage

To use the application, sign in or create an account by clicking "Sign In" or "Log In" in the upper right corner and follow the prompts; once logged in, search for books using the search bar and add them to your list by clicking "Add Book," view and manage your list by clicking "See Your Books" and use the "Remove" button to delete books; if not logged in, you can search for books but cannot add or manage them.
